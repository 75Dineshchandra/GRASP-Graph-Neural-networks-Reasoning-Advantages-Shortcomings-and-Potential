# 
# retrieve_ ‚Üí A more detailed version of get_.
# It often brings back richer or more structured information ‚Äî like pulling a full report instead of a summary.
# 
# drug_ ‚Üí Tools that focus specifically on drugs.
# These might include side effects, approvals, or how a drug interacts with other things.
# 
# target_ ‚Üí Tools about biological targets (like genes or proteins).
# Helpful for understanding what a drug is aimed at in the body.
# 
# search_ ‚Üí Used to look for something when you don‚Äôt know the exact name.
# Like typing a few letters into Google and getting suggestions.
# 
# multi_ ‚Üí Tools that deal with multiple types of information at once ‚Äî like drugs and diseases and genes.

# - The `run()` function executes the tool with the provided input and returns detailed information, such as:

# üß™ Running Sample Tool Queries Across Multiple Domains
# 
# This block demonstrates how to programmatically run a list of diverse tool queries using the `ToolUniverse` interface.
# 
# Each entry in the `sample_queries` list contains:
# - A **tool name** indicating what function to call
# - A dictionary of **arguments** relevant to the tool's purpose
# 
# The tools being tested here span across different domains:
# - **Biomedical** (`FDA_get_active_ingredient_info_by_drug_name`)
# - **Bioinformatics** (`get_target_enabling_packages_by_ensemblID`)
# - **Scientific search** (`arxiv_search_paper_by_topic`)
# - **General knowledge** (`Wikipedia_summary`)
# 
# The `try...except` block ensures graceful handling of tools that might throw an error due to:
# - Incorrect arguments
# - Missing tools
# - Backend/API issues
# 
# This is a useful pattern when building AI agents or pipelines that work with heterogeneous tools.

# #### üß† Overview: Executing Biomedical KG Tool Functions Across Domains
# 
# 
# This cell demonstrates the execution of various mock biomedical tool functions, grouped by data source or domain. Each function simulates a typical query you might perform using a biomedical API or knowledge graph.
# 
# üß™ Tool Groups & Their Purpose
# Monarch Tools:
# Focus on phenotypes, diseases, and genes. These tools help link symptoms (phenotypes) to genes or find overlapping features between diseases.
# 
# Open Targets Tools:
# Explore relationships between drugs, targets (genes/proteins), and diseases, which is key for drug discovery and disease treatment research.
# 
# openFDA KG Tools (Knowledge Graph Queries):
# These tools interact with structured knowledge graph data:
# 
# get_drug_gene_interactions_by_drug_name
# ‚Üí Retrieves gene targets for a drug.
# 
# get_pathway_nodes_by_disease_name
# ‚Üí Fetches biological pathway components related to a disease.
# 
# get_gene_ontology_terms
# ‚Üí Lists standardized functions and processes associated with a gene.
# 
# These queries operate over interconnected biomedical entities (like a graph of nodes and edges), making them ideal for tasks like: Relationship extraction, Graph traversal, Reasoning over biomedical data

# %% [markdown]
# #### Summary

# %% [markdown]
# üß∞ ToolUniverse Overview
# 
# **ToolUniverse** is a unified interface that connects to a wide range of biomedical tools and APIs, many of which operate on structured knowledge graph (KG) data. It allows researchers and developers to execute queries related to diseases, genes, drugs, phenotypes, and more using simple commands.
# 
# ---
# 
# üìÇ Tool Sources & Categories
# 
# ToolUniverse integrates tools from multiple specialized sources:
# 
# - **Monarch**: Works with phenotypes, diseases, and genes using ontologies like HPO.
# - **Open Targets**: Focuses on drug‚Äìgene‚Äìdisease relationships to support drug discovery.
# - **openFDA KG Tools**: Provides access to structured drug data based on FDA labeling.
# - **Special Tools**: Includes AI-driven utilities for summarization, search, and agent reasoning.
# 
# ---
# 
# ‚öôÔ∏è Tool Name Prefixes (What They Mean)
# 
# Tool names follow a predictable pattern. The prefix hints at the tool‚Äôs purpose:
# 
# - `get_` ‚Üí Quick lookup (e.g., `get_disease_description`)
# - `retrieve_` ‚Üí Detailed fetch (e.g., `retrieve_pathway_nodes`)
# - `drug_`, `target_`, `disease_` ‚Üí Specialized tools for specific biomedical entities
# - `search_` ‚Üí Performs searches by keyword or concept
# - `multi_` ‚Üí Involves multiple types of entities (e.g., drug + disease)
# - `tool_`, `callagent`, `finish` ‚Üí Internal tools for reasoning workflows
# 
# ---
# 
# üîç Example Tool Use Cases
# 
# - `get_HPO_ID_by_phenotype`: Get the HPO ID for a human phenotype like "muscle weakness"
# - `get_drug_targets`: List genes targeted by a specific drug (e.g., Ibuprofen)
# - `get_gene_ontology_terms`: Get biological functions linked to a gene
# - `arxiv_search_paper_by_topic`: Find recent papers on a research topic
# - `Wikipedia_summary`: Get a short summary of a concept like "Graph Neural Networks"
# 
# ---
# 
# üß† Knowledge Graph Relevance
# 
# Many tools operate over knowledge graphs:
# - **Entities** (nodes): drugs, genes, diseases, phenotypes
# - **Relationships** (edges): "treats", "interacts with", "has phenotype"
# 
# This enables:
# - Semantic search
# - Biological reasoning
# - Multi-step tool chaining (e.g., drug ‚Üí gene ‚Üí disease ‚Üí treatment)
# 
# ---
# 
# üõ†Ô∏è How to Use a Tool
# 
# Tools are executed using a dictionary-style query:
# ```python
# query = {
#     "name": "get_drug_targets",
#     "arguments": {"drug": "Aspirin"}
# }
# output = tooluni.run(query)
#
