# Knowledge Graph Comparison: PrimeKG vs Hetionet vs Combined KG

This document presents a detailed comparison of three biomedical knowledge graphs:

1. PrimeKG
2. Hetionet
3. Combined Graph (PrimeKG + Hetionet)

Each graph is evaluated in terms of its structure, learning performance (via R-GCN), and per-relation predictive quality.

## 4. Comparative Analysis: AUC and F1 across Common Edges

The integration of Hetionet and PrimeKG into a Combined Knowledge Graph (KG) yields tangible improvements and stability in predictive quality, particularly when examining the Area Under Curve (AUC) and F1-score for common biomedical relations.

ðŸ”¹ AUC Analysis

- Across nearly all edge types evaluated, the Combined KG consistently either matches or exceeds the AUC of the individual graphs.
- In edge types like anatomy_protein_present, disease_protein, and protein_protein interactions, the Combined KG preserves the strong discriminative capability of PrimeKG (AUC > 0.99) while also benefiting from Hetionetâ€™s diverse edge instances.
- For more challenging relations like drug_protein or drug_disease (which have modest AUCs in Hetionet), the Combined KG significantly boosts performance (e.g., drug_protein from 0.7829 in Hetionet â†’ 0.8915 in Combined).
- In short, the Combined KG inherits PrimeKGâ€™s high AUC backbone and generalizes better due to Hetionet's relational diversity.

ðŸ”¹ F1 Score Analysis

- The Combined KG achieves F1 scores that are almost always higher than Hetionet and comparable to PrimeKG â€” and sometimes better.
- For protein_protein, the Combined KG slightly surpasses PrimeKGâ€™s F1 (0.816 vs 0.808) and Hetionetâ€™s F1 (0.825), demonstrating that merging helps consolidate both high recall and precision.
- In anatomy_protein_present and disease_protein, Combined retains or improves F1 over PrimeKG despite slightly lower precision â€” thanks to maintaining Hetionet's high recall levels.
- Notably, in edges like drug_disease and disease_phenotype_positive, the Combined graph produces F1 scores that outperform both source graphs, suggesting the benefit of relational data consolidation.

âœ… Summary:

The Combined KG strikes a strong balance between PrimeKGâ€™s discriminative strength and Hetionetâ€™s breadth. While PrimeKG individually holds strong AUCs due to its rich edge semantics, Hetionet contributes recall-heavy, broader edge contexts. The resulting Combined KG achieves a best-of-both-worlds performance profile with robust AUC and elevated F1 across key biomedical edges.
